# infoviz - Group 16

**Introduction Team:**

- Julia Glöß 
- Johanna Carolina Gerhardt
- Tobias Theus
- Nina Wüst

**Goals:**

- Visualize occurrence and frequency of patent registrations by location
- Finding relationships and correlations between locations and patent types (i.e. silicon valley for technological patents) 
- Exploring trends of patent registrations over time in certain locations
- Combine data set with other social-geographic aspects such as conflict zones
- Combine conflict databases to visualize how conflict can affect patent registration and patent class

**Research Questions:**

- Is there a link between conflicts and patent registration and patent classes?
- Are patent registrations linked with innovation and technological development?
- Are there any connections of areas that are ripe with conflict, especially over longer period of time, with the amount of patent registrations?
- Do conflicts inhibit infrastructure development, which in turn inhibit patent development in certain ipc classes that rely the existence of a more complex infrastructure?
- Are there any potential relationships between countries that initiate conflict and weapon related patents?

**Visualiziation:**
- Map with  juxtaposition of data and tools for filtering/manipulation

_Interactions:_
- Zoom functionality
- Map filters
- Moving tool
- Timeline
- “On-Map-Clicking”
- Buttons / Clusters

**Results:**

**Abnormalities:**
